description: "Queries whether an entry is contained in the blocklist in Optimizely Campaign."

This method queries only exact matches.

If, for example, "\*@example.com" is contained in the blocklist and you query [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7ddd8dfd9f7d2cfd6dac7dbd299d4d8da) using this method, false is returned. If you query @example.com, true is returned. To a query both exact matches as well as wildcards, use the [isBlacklisted](/optimizely-campaign/docs/isblacklisted) method.
