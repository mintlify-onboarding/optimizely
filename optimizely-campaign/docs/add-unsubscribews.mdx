title: "add"
description: "Adds a recipient to a unsubscribe list in Optimizely Campaign."
---

The recipient is unsubscribed from all recipient lists (but is not informed). The unsubscribe status is valid until the [remove](/optimizely-campaign/docs/remove-unsubscribews) method is invoked or the recipient re-subscribes using a "normal" opt-in process.

Use this method to mark a recipient as _unsubscribed_. Recipients added to the unsubscribe list using this method are still visible in the recipient list, but are skipped when the mailing is sent.

To undo this step and re-subscribe a recipient, use the [remove](/optimizely-campaign/docs/remove-unsubscribews) method. Be aware that re-adding a recipient using the [add2](/optimizely-campaign/docs/add2) method also removes the recipient from the unsubscribe list if he/she had previously been marked as unsubscribed and no opt-in process ID is submitted.

| recipientListId | long   | (Optional) Recipient list to which the recipient is assigned.If a client-wide unsubscribe list is configured, this parameter is meaningless.
