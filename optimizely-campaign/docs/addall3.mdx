title: "addAll3"
description: "Adds multiple recipients to an existing recipient list in Optimizely Campaign."
---

Be aware of the different behavior of this method according to the recipient status:

* If there is already a recipient with the same ID and the same type of opt-in process that has not completed the opt-in process, the recipient is removed and re-added. If one of the opt-in processes is a double opt-in process and the other is not, the double opt-in process has a higher priority (see [Prioritization of parallel opt-in processes](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413192291981#prioritization)).

Be aware of the different behavior of this method according to the target recipient list:

* If a recipient is unsubscribed and the target recipient list an opt-in list, the recipient will be re-activated with this method and the unsubscribe status will be reset.
* If a recipient is unsubscribed and the target recipient list a regular list, the unsubscribe status will not be changed and the recipient will not receive any further emails.

This method can be replaced by the .NET replacement method [addAll3Flat](https://world.optimizely.com/documentation/developer-guides/campaign/SOAP-API/recipientwebservice/addall3flat/).

Example structure for **attributeNames** and **attributeValues**

Text

`$attributeNames = array('Salutation','Firstname','Lastname');
    $arrayRecipient1 = array("Mr","John","Doe");$arrayRecipient2 = array("Mrs","Jane","Doe");$arrayRecipient3 = array("Mr","Peter","Jackson");
    $attributeValues = array($arrayRecipient1 ,$arrayRecipient2 ,$arrayRecipient3 );
`

**Return values**

For each recipient:

* 0: Recipient was added
* 1: Recipient validation failed, e.g., due to invalid email address syntax
* 2: Recipient is unsubscribed (applies only if the target recipient list is a regular list and no opt-in list)
* 3: Recipient is blocked
* 4: Recipient is bounce overflowed (i.e., produced too many bounces in the past)
* 5: Recipient is already in the list
* 6: Recipient has been filtered
* 7: A general error occurred
