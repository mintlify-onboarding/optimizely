title: "addAll3Flat"
description: "Adds multiple recipients to an existing recipient list in Optimizely Campaign."
---

Be aware of the different behavior of this method according to the recipient status:

* If there is already a recipient with the same ID and the same type of opt-in process that has not completed the opt-in process, the recipient is removed and re-added. If one of the opt-in processes is a double opt-in process and the other is not, the double opt-in process has a higher priority (see [Prioritization of parallel opt-in processes](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413192291981#prioritization)).

Be aware of the different behavior of this method according to the target recipient list:

* If a recipient is unsubscribed and the target recipient list an opt-in list, the recipient will be re-activated with this method and the unsubscribe status will be reset.
* If a recipient is unsubscribed and the target recipient list a regular list, the unsubscribe status will not be changed and the recipient will not receive any further emails.

This is a .NET replacement method. For other applications use the method [addAll3](/optimizely-campaign/docs/addall3).
