### Java

The native Java API is based on Axis (tested with version 1.2) and is accessed via a **factory class**.

The following libraries must be embedded:

* optivo-broadmail-api\*.jar (this library can be found in [this ZIP file](https://world.optimizely.com/globalassets/downloads/episerver-campaign/replaced-181018-episerver-campaign-soap-api.zip))
* axis\*
* axis-jaxrpc\*
* org.apache.commons
* commons-discovery\*
* commons-logging\*
* javax.mail\*
* wsdl4j\*

**Example**

C#

`import broadmail.api.soapll.*;
    import broadmail.api.soapll.factory.*;
    try 
      {
        // Obtain a factory
        WebserviceFactory factory = WebserviceFactory.newInstance();
        // From that factory all webservice interfaces are available
        // As an example we will perform a login and a blacklist check
        SessionWebservice sessionWebservice = factory.newSessionWebservice();
        String session = sessionWebservice.login(1234, "user", "pass");
        BlacklistWebservice blacklistWebservice = factory.newBlacklistWebservice();
        boolean isBlacklisted = blacklistWebservice.isBlacklisted(session, "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)");
        sessionWebservice.logout(session);
      } 
    catch (WebserviceException exception)
      {
        //An error occured
        exception.print.StackTrace();
      }
`

### PHP

The webservice API can be queried directly and easily using the native PHP SOAP interface (from PHP 5.0.1 and newer). Whenever the API expects binary data (java.langByte\[\]), these must be submitted as a string. The string must represent the binary data. To read the binary data of a file, you may use the operation file\_get\_contents(). The following example shows the login and adding of an email address to a recipient list:

You can find the below mentioned **mandatorId** (i.e., the client ID) by performing the following steps:

1. Open the Optimizely Campaign start menu and, under **Administration**, click **API Overview**.  
The **API Overview** window opens.
2. Switch to the **SOAP API** tab.  
Beneath the **Client ID** heading, you can find the client ID of the client you are currently working in.

Sample script for the native SOAP interface (from PHP 5.0.1):

PHP

`$client = new SoapClient('http://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/RpcSession?wsdl');
    $webservice = new SoapClient('http://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/RpcRecipient?wsdl');
     
    $session = $client->login($mandatorId, $username, $password);
    $operation = $webservice->add2($session, $recipientListId, $optinProcessId, $recipientId, $emailAddress, $attributeNames, $attributeValues);
    $session = $client->logout($session);
     
    echo '<pre>';
    var_dump($operation);
    echo '</pre>';
    ?>
`

#### Libraries for older PHP versions

If you are using an older PHP version (prior to version 5.0.1), we provide a library and samples in the archive file of this documentation to embed in your PHP. For PHP version 5.0.1 and newer, this library is deprecated, since it comes with a native SOAP client.

The following example shows the login and query of the blocklist status of an email address:

Sample script for NuSOAP Interface for older PHP Versions:

PHP

`// Include the library
    require_once('broadmail_rpc.php');
     
    // Create a new factory and login.
    // 1234 is the mandatorId, "user" and "pass" are credentials
    $factory = new BroadmailRpcFactory(1234, 'user', 'pass');
     
    // This is how error handling works. You should check the result of the getError() method
    // after each(!) call to a webservice method
    if ($factory->getError())
      {
        die('Error during login. Details: '.$factory->getError());
      }
     
    // Now create a BlacklistWebservice instance ans a call method.
    $blacklistWs = $factory->newBlacklistWebservice();
     
    $isBlacklisted = $blacklistWs->isBlacklisted('[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)');
    if  ($blacklistWs->getError())
      {
        die ('Error while checking blacklist status. Details: '.$factory->getError())
      }
     
    // Don't forget to log out.
    $factory->logout();
     
    // Print out the result.
    if ($isBlacklisted)
      {
        echo 'The emailadress "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)" is blacklisted!');
      }
`

### .NET

If you want to use the SOAP-API with a .NET framework, all methods that require to submit a multidimensional array or return such arrays must be replaced by replacement methods. The reason for this is that .NET does not support processing of multidimensional arrays.

**Example**:

To query several recipients in the **RecipientWebservice**, the default method **getAll** would return a multidimensional array with the following pattern:

PHP

`[ 
      [email1, firstName1, lastName1] 
      [email2, firstName2, lastName2] 
      [email3, firstName3, lastName3] 
    ]
`

This array cannot be processed by the .NET framework. Use the replacement method **getAllFlat** instead. The returned array in this method has been flattened to the following pattern:

PHP

`[email1, firstName1, lastName1, email2, firstName2, lastName2, email3, firstName3, lastName3]
`

To process this array, the fields must be indexed to allocate the respective fields to one recipient.
