### Locale-based information

Some methods (mostly reporting functions) require parameters for localization. The localization version for the current session can be set active by using the [setLocale](/optimizely-campaign/docs/setlocale) method. The default value is de for German.

### Media type

Some API methods work differently on different media types (such as EMAILor SMS). Use the [setMediaType](/optimizely-campaign/docs/setmediatype) method to switch between media types. Default is EMAIL.
