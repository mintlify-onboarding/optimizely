description: "Adds a recipient to a recipient list in Optimizely Campaign."

Be aware of the different behavior of this method according to the recipient status:

* If there is already a recipient with the same ID and the same type of opt-in process that has not completed the opt-in process, the recipient is removed and re-added. If one of the opt-in processes is a double opt-in process and the other is not, the double opt-in process has a higher priority (see [Prioritization of parallel opt-in processes](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413192291981#prioritization)).
* If the recipient that is added with this method has been marked as unsubscribed and if no opt-in process ID is submitted, this recipient is activated immediately and receive mailings from your client. No further opt-in process is triggered.

**Type**: int

| optinProcessId  | long        | ID of the opt-in process. The recipient will be processed with the given opt-in process identified by this ID.
