title: "Automatic tracking link extension job"
description: "Adds parameters to the tracking URL of a mailing."
---

* The TrackingLinkExtender adds parameters to the tracking URL of a mailing. This can be needed for example for an integration into a webtracking system.
* The extension is also functional for links in test emails.
* The parameters can consist of fixed values, field functions or recipient list fields.

You must have link tracking activated. The extension is done during rendering so that the added parameters do not exist in the decoded tracking link.
