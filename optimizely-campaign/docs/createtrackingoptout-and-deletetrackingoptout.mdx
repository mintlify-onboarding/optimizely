title: "createtrackingoptout and deletetrackingoptout"
description: "Deactivate and reactivate the use of action-based data for a recipient in Optimizely Campaign."
---

These procedures are available in the form and mail service.

On forms or in emails, you can give recipients the option to reject the use of personally identifiable data. If they do, the recipients are not included in action-based target groups (e.g., "has clicked Link B in Mailing A"), even if they meet the conditions of the target group.

> * Opens and clicks are still saved anonymously and included in global reports. The open and clicks in a mailing of such a recipient would therefore be counted. However, the recipient is not taken into account if you create a target group containing all recipients of this mailing who opened or clicked it.
> * All personal action-based data are anonymized from the time of activation. Action data in the recipient history is not retrospectively anonymized.
