* The blocklist import job imports blocklist entries from a CSV file into the Campaign blocklist on a regular basis.
* Set the import frequency to daily, weekly or monthly.
* You can skip the import of entries that are older than for example 1 day.

This job can only add data to the blocklist. It is not possible to delete blocklist entries.

Changes to the structure of your CSV file can result in errors during import. Report all changes to the CSV file structure to Optimizely customer support so that the import job can be adjusted.
