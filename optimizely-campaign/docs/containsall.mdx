See also: [contains](/optimizely-campaign/docs/contains-blacklist).

This method queries only exact matches. If, for example, "\*@example.com" is contained in the blocklist and you query [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#157f7a7d7b55706d74786579703b767a78) using this method, false is returned. If you query @example.com, true is returned. To a query both exact matches as well as wildcards, use the [areBlacklisted](/optimizely-campaign/docs/areblacklisted) method.
