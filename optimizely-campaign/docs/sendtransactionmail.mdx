> Notes on using this operation
> 
> * You can use this operation to send mailings to existing recipients.
> * Each call of this operation creates a new recipient dataset.
> * Unsubscribes and bounces are always associated with the ID field (which may be, for example, the email address) of the recipient list used.
> * Use this operation only for confirmation mails, notifications, status mails, or new subscriptions in case recipients forgot their password.
> * Some of these transactional mails must be free of promotional content.
> * This operation is available in the form service.
> * You need a transaction recipient list (recipient list with the property "Transaction API") and its authorization code. See API overview. To set up a transaction recipient list, contact [customer support](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6615131616091412260916120f0b0f1c030a1f4805090b).

> ❗️
> 
> Warning
> 
> Never use this HTTP API request directly on a web page. HTTP API requests of the form service must always be executed by the server without exposing the used source code to others. Otherwise there is a potential risk that other web user read these data and send emails from your client and at your expense.
