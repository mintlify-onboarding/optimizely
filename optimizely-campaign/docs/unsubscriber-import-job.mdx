* The automated unsubscriber import job imports unsubscriber entries from a CSV file into the system-internal unsubscribe list on a regular basis.
* Set the import frequency to daily, weekly, or monthly.

This job can only add new unsubscribers to the system-internal unsubscribe list. Existing unsubscriber entries cannot be deleted.

Changes to the structure of your CSV file can result in errors during import. Report all changes to the CSV file structure to Optimizely customer support so that the import job can be adjusted
