**Type**: String\[ \]

**Parameters**

| Name            | Type   | Value                    |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| sessionId       | String | ID of the session        |
| mailingId       | long   | ID of the mailing        |
| recipientListId | long   | ID of the recipient list |
| recipientId     | String | ID of the recipient      |

**Return values**

An array of **SENT**,**date** or **ERROR,date**, where **date** is formatted according to ISO 8601 (see also [Type conversion and formatting rules](/optimizely-campaign/docs/soap-1-1-compatibility)).

The return value is given in a matrix, since it is theoretically possible for one and the same recipient to receive a mailing several times (only for mailings of type Event).

**Code structure**

`String[] getSendingStatus(String sessionId, long mailingId, long recipientListId, String recipientId)
