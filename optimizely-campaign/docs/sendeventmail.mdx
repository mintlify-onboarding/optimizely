title: "sendeventmail"
description: "Sends an event mailing to a single recipient in Optimizely Campaign."
---

Use this function to send, for example, confirmation emails, notifications, or status updates to existing recipients. In some cases, it may be useful to use the [sendtransactionmail](/optimizely-campaign/docs/sendtransactionmail) operation instead.

This operation is available in the mail and the form service.

> ❗️
> 
> Warning
> 
> Never use this HTTP API request directly on a web page or in a mailing. HTTP API requests of the form service must always be executed by the server without exposing the used source code to others. Otherwise, there is a potential risk that other web users will read this data and send emails from your client at your expense. To use HTTP operations in mailings, use the mail service of the HTTP API (see [Mail service](/optimizely-campaign/docs/services-and-operations)).
