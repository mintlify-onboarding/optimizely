---

Basically, you need three things to use the web services in Optimizely Campaign:

* A functional SOAP 1.1 client environment
* A valid Optimizely Campaign account that has the permission to access the SOAP API (provided by Optimizely)
* A client ID (provided by Optimizely)

### List of web services

### Validity of a session

A session is always valid for 20 minutes, i.e., after this time the so-called **sessionId** becomes invalid and you must request a new one. To do so, use the [login](/optimizely-campaign/docs/login) method.

### Web service endpoints

Currently, all web services are deployed RPC-encoded only. Each web service is deployed under a URL of the form. We recommend always using an encrypted SSL connection using the HTTPS protocol:

`http://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/Rpc[WebserviceName]
https://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/Rpc[WebserviceName]
`

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Note
> 
> Replace **\[WebserviceName\]** with the name of the actual web service _without_ the term **webservice**. For example, the **SessionWebservice** is deployed under the URL _[http://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/RpcSession](http://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/RpcSession)_.

### Coupon system web services

The WSDLs for the CouponBlock and CouponCode web service of the coupon system can be found under the following links:

`https://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/addons/CouponCode?wsdl
https://api.campaign.episerver.net/soap11/addons/CouponBlock?wsdl
`

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Note
> 
> These web services are not part of the standard distribution of our SOAP API. They must be activated separately. To do this, you need the Optimizely Campaign add-on [coupon system](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413192215949-Introduction-to-the-coupon-system). Contact [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ff8c8a8f8f908d8bbf908f8b969296859a9386d19c9092) if you want to use this function.

### Error messages

Throughout the whole API, errors are reported as exceptions (SOAP faults). So you should implement some kind of error handling on the client side.

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Note
> 
> Due to updates on the API, HTTP responses will no longer contain the default reason phrase (status description) appended to the HTTP status code, such as _HTTP 200 "OK"_ or _HTTP 404 "NOT FOUND"_. If your API client relies on the reason phrase, and to avoid system failures, please adjust your API response handling to ignore the reason phrase until **2021-12-31**. See also [HTTP specification RFC 7230 3.1.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.2).

### Usage example

Here is a short example (written in pseudo Java syntax) that illustrates the process flow of a web service session:

`// Login to the client 1234 
// The session ID obtained by this call is needed to call any other webservice's method. 
// A session is valid for 20 minutes. String sessionID = SessionWebservice.login(1234, "myusername", "mypassword"); 
// Call some methods. In this example we retrieve the ids of all regular mailings available. long[] mailingIds = MailingWebservice.getIds(sessionId, "regular"); 
// Now do something with the mailingIds ... 
// Finally logout SessionWebservice.logout (sessionId);
