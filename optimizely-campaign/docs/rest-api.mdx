title: "REST API"
description: "Integrate Optimizely Campaign features into your software or manage and control them remotely by using HTTP requests."

The REST API is a convenient alternative to the SOAP API that lets you also manage Smart Campaigns.

See also: [REST API resource documentation](https://world.optimizely.com/documentation/class-libraries/rest-apis/campaign/optimizely-campaign-rest-api-1/)

REST supports several standards and formats, such as HTTPS, URI, JSON and XML. You can retrieve data from and send data to Optimizely Campaign via REST API.

### What can I do with the REST API?

You can execute virtually any function of Optimizely Campaign from a remote system without using the web browser and logging into your client manually, for example:

* Campaign management  
   * Activate and start a Smart Campaign  
   * Get report data of sent mailings  
   * Create and send transactional messages
* Recipient management  
   * Create recipient lists and add new recipients  
   * Update blocklists or create a custom blocklist  
   * Add recipients to an unsubscribe list
* Bounce management  
   * Check the bounce status of recipients  
   * Reset the bounce counter of a recipient
