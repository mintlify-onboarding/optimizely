With scheduled jobs, you can automate regular tasks in Optimizely Campaign. Scheduled jobs are additional features that are charged via the support services, according to the time and effort involved.

Using scheduled jobs requires an **SCP account**. Optimizely customer support will set this up on request and provide you with the path for uploading and downloading files on Optimizely's servers. See also [Optimizely User Guide](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413192168461-Introduction-to-transferring-files-through-SCP).

The list contains e.g. import and export jobs for recipient lists, blocklists, unsubscribers or outbounced recipients that run automatically on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Use the form on each job's page to send a direct request to Optimizely customer support for setting up the job for your client. To get information on which scheduled jobs are already configured or running in your client, you can use the [Optimizely Campaign REST API](https://api.campaign.episerver.net/apidoc/index.html#/Scheduled%20jobs).
