### Temporary target groups

Temporary target groups are only valid during the current session. These target groups can be used in ad hoc queries. You should use temporary target groups where possible since relying on persistent target groups may cause problems with concurrent modifications (by users of Optimizely Campaign). Using the RecipientFilterWebservice, you can [create temporary target groups](/optimizely-campaign/docs/createtemporary) and [check whether a target group is temporary](/optimizely-campaign/docs/istemporary).

### Conditions

A target group consists of multiple conditions tied together by the AND or OR operator. Each condition consists of the following parameters:

* **Negate condition (y/n)**: A boolean that defines whether the condition will be wrapped in a NOT condition
* **Attribut** **e**: The name of the recipient attribute the condition is based on
* **Operator**: The name of the operation (like > or equals)
* **Attribute value**: One or more parameters to the operation

These conditions are to be read in the logic: negate condition (y/n) \[attribute name-operator-attribute value\], e.g.:

`[residence-is(equals)-Berlin]
`

### Available operators

Read the notation of the available operations as follows:

`operator(param1, param2)
`

whereas param1 and param2 are the attribute values you provide to the methods [addAndCondition](/optimizely-campaign/docs/addandcondition) and [addOrCondition](/optimizely-campaign/docs/addorcondition).

The following operators are available:

* **contains(value)**: applicable only to attributes of the type **String**  
This filter is case insensitive.
* **startsWith(value)**: applicable only to attributes of the type **String**  
This filter is case insensitive.
* **endsWith(value)**: applicable only to attributes of the type **String**  
This filter is case insensitive.
* **isEmpty()**: applicable to all attributes
* **isNotEmpty()**: applicable to all attributes
* **\==(value)**: Aapplicable to all attributes  
 This filter is case insensitive.
* **\>=(value)**: applicable only to attributes of type **Number**, **boolean** and **Date**.
* **\>(value)**: applicable only to attributes of type **Number**, **boolean** and **Date**.
* **<=(value)**: applicable only to attributes of type **Number**, **boolean** and **Date**.
* **<(value)**: applicable only to attributes of type **Number**, **boolean** and **Date**.
* **receivedMailing(mailingId)**: Checks whether a recipient has received the mailing with the given ID. Provide 0 as **mailingId** to test whether the recipient received any mailing. **attributeName** is not used.
* **openedMailing(mailingId)**: Checks whether a recipient has opened the mailing with the given ID. Provide 0 as **mailingId** to test whether the recipient opened any mailing. **attributeName** is not used.

### Attribute values

If not otherwise stated, attribute values and attributes must be of the same type. All attribute values for an operation must be given as strings. See [Type conversion and formatting rules](/optimizely-campaign/docs/soap-1-1-compatibility) for detailed information on how to convert values.

**Example: Creates a target group that selects all Gmail recipients**
