A **mail ID** identifies a single mail that has been sent to a single recipient. It is the aggregation of these three IDs: **mailing ID**, **recipient list ID** and **recipient ID**. The **mail ID** can be appended to a tracked link.

| Method             | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| getMailingId       | Queries the mailing ID.                                      |
| getMandatorId      | Queries the client's ID.                                     |
| getRecipientId     | Queries the ID of a recipient that received a mail.          |
| getRecipientListId | Queries the ID of the recipient list a recipient belongs to. |

### Using mail IDs

To include the **mail ID** into a tracking link, use the special field function **{bmMailId}**.

**Example**

`http://www.example.com/mypage.php?myId={bmMailId}
`

Within **mypage.php**, the parameter **myId** contains the mail ID.
