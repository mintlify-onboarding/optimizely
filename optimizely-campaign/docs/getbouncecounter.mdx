title: "getBounceCounter"
description: "Counts the hard or soft bounces for a recipient in Optimizely Campaign."
---

See also: [resetBounceCounter](/optimizely-campaign/docs/resetbouncecounter) and [getBounceCounterThreshold](/optimizely-campaign/docs/getbouncecounterthreshold).

This number is different from the one returned by [getRecipientResponseCount2](/optimizely-campaign/docs/getrecipientresponsecount2) as this is the counter used to determine if a recipient will receive further mailings. This bounce counter may be reset to re-enable a recipient once the bounce threshold (usually three _hard bounces_ and five _soft bounces_) is exceeded.

By default, the media type EMAIL is used. Use the SessionWebservice's [setMediaType](/optimizely-campaign/docs/setmediatype) method to select another media type such as SMS.
