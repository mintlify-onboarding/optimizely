### Prerequisites

* A website (web app) to implement push notifications.

> ðŸ“˜

> 
> Use a different website than your main one for testing. You can create a test website using [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/ "Firebase website").
> 
> * A user account for [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ "Firebase website"), a free cross-platform solution for sending push messages.
> * Optimizely Campaign test recipient list of type "Push" that customer support sets up for you.

### Set up the website

1. Create a web app [project in Firebase](/optimizely-campaign/docs/web-push) and provide Optimizely with the required information for the [push assignment](/optimizely-campaign/docs/web-push).
2. Integrate your website with the Firebase JavaScript SDK. See [Integrating the Firebase SDK](/optimizely-campaign/docs/web-push).

>  
> Note  
>  
> If you use Firebase Hosting, see [Firebase Cloud Messaging Quickstart](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-js/tree/master/messaging "GitHub website") for an integration guide.
1. Save the user registration token generated during the [opt-in process](/optimizely-campaign/docs/web-push).
2. Add a new recipient with the user registration token to the test recipient list in Optimizely Campaign. See [Opt-in](/optimizely-campaign/docs/web-push).

### Send a Web Push test message via Smart Campaigns

**Prerequisites:** Push notifications are enabled in your web browser.  
**Context:** To test the Web Push message, create a campaign in [Smart Campaigns](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413205648269-Introduction-to-Smart-Campaigns).

1. Log in to Optimizely Campaign and select the client for which Web Push has been configured.
2. Open the start menu and select **Campaigns** \> **Smart Campaigns**.
3. Create a new campaign using the **Recipient** node and the **Web Push** node. See [Creating and editing a campaign](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413205648269-Introduction-to-Smart-Campaigns) in the Optimizely User Guide.
4. Configure the Web Push message. See [Configuring the message](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413205648269-Introduction-to-Smart-Campaigns) in the Optimizely User Guide.
5. Click **Push test message** and send the Web Push test message**.** See [Smart Campaigns nodes](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413200602509%22) in the Optimizely User Guide.

The Web Push message is displayed in the web browser when opening.
