### Unsubscribe list

Each client uses one unsubscribe list. If there is an unsubscribe for any recipient list the recipient is added to this list and will not receive any further mailings send by this client.

### Internal processing of unsubscribes

Internally, an unsubscribe event does not simply remove a recipient from the corresponding recipient list. Each unsubscribe is stored internally and must be removed explicitly. This is done if the recipient re-subscribes via a web form or by invoking the [remove](/optimizely-campaign/docs/remove-unsubscribews) method.
