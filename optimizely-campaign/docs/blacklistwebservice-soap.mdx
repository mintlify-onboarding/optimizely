### Entries vs. email addresses

Note that there is a difference between a blocklist entry and a blocked email address. Since blocklisting can be done using wildcards (see next section), a blocklist entry may block several email addresses. To query the first matching blocklist entry for an email address, use the [getFirstMatchingEntry](/optimizely-campaign/docs/getfirstmatchingentry) method.

A single email address may be blocked by several blocklist entries. So, if you like to make sure that an email address is not blocked any more, the methods [getFirstMatchingEntry](/optimizely-campaign/docs/getfirstmatchingentry) and [remove](/optimizely-campaign/docs/remove-blacklist) have to be invoked until **getFirstMatchingEntry** returns NULL.

### Wildcards

An entry can contain the following wildcards:

* An \* (asterisk) represents one or more characters.
* A ? represents a single character.

**Examples**

* \*@example.com: all email addresses of the domain "example.com".
* [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection): "[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e882878086c68c878da88d90898598848dc68b8785)" or "[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#117b7e797f3f757e62517469707c617d743f727e7c)" etc.
