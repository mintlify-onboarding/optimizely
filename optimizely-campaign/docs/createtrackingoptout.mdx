> 
> * Opens and clicks are still saved anonymously and included in global reports. The open and clicks in a mailing of such a recipient would therefore be counted. However, if you create a target group containing all recipients of this mailing who opened or clicked it, the recipient is not taken into account.
> * All personal action-based data are anonymised from the time of activation. Action-based data in the recipient history is not retrospectively anonymized.
