### Form service

The form service is used for the integration of forms (e.g. a registration form). The form service is linked by an authorization code to a specific recipient list. All operations within this service relate to this recipient list. Since the form service is usually used by a single server, you should always use IP security. To select the form service, enter the service selector value form. For example:

`http://api.campaign.episerver.net/http/form/....
`

### Mail service

The mail service is used for the integration of profile updates by email. You can add personal data to the recipients' profiles or move them to another list. Since the mail service is used by multiple users, IP security is not possible. The authorization code generated by the system is protected by a checksum against tampering. To select the mail service, enter the service selector value mail. Instead of an authorization code, insert the placeholder {bmMailId}, which is automatically replaced in each email by a value. For example:

`http://api.campaign.episerver.net/http/mail/{bmMailId}/unsubscribe
`

### Operations

The following topics describe the operations in more detail. To select one of these operations, use the name of the operation as the operation selector.
