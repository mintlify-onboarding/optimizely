title: "addByMailId"
description: "Unsubscribes a recipient that belongs to a specific mail-ID in Optimizely Campaign."
---

The recipient is not removed from the recipient list (but will not receive any further mailings) until the [remove](/optimizely-campaign/docs/remove-unsubscribews) method is invoked or the recipient re-subscribes using a normal opt-in process.

In addition to the [add2](/optimizely-campaign/docs/add2) method, the mailing the recipient received before she/he unsubscribed will be preserved. See also [MailIdWebservice](/optimizely-campaign/docs/mailidwebservice).
