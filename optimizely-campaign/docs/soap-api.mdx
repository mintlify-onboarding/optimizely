You can execute virtually any function of Optimizely Campaign from a remote system without using the web browser and logging into your client manually. The interface is bi-directional, which means that you can send and receive data from/to Optimizely Campaign. The following processes can be executed with the SOAP API:

* Create recipient lists and add new recipients
* Edit recipient lists and recipients
* Update and synchronize blacklists
* Create temporary and permanent target groups
* Create mailings, add content and dispatch mailings
* Bounce management
